# AlphaCode Recreation Using CrewAI: Comprehensive Planning

## Stage 1: Research and Design

### Objectives:
- Understand AlphaCode's architecture and components.
- Map AlphaCode components to CrewAI concepts.
- Design the AlphaCode Crew's high-level structure.

### Tasks:
1. Conduct a thorough review of the AlphaCode technical report.
2. Identify key components and their roles.
3. Define roles, goals, and backstories for each AlphaCode Crew agent.
4. Specify required tools and customizations for agents.
5. Create detailed task descriptions and expected outputs.
6. Define task dependencies and execution order.
7. Identify necessary custom tools for code execution, similarity detection, and submission.
8. Design the overall process flow for AlphaCode Crew.

### Considerations:
- Clear mapping between AlphaCode components and CrewAI concepts.
- Scalability and performance of the designed architecture.
- Identify potential challenges or bottlenecks.

## Stage 2: Implementation
