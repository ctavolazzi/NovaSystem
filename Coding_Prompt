Nova Process Programming Iteration Cycle Prompt with File Tree and Goals:

Define File Tree and Goals
a. List the file tree structure that indicates the modules and components of the application.
b. Define the specific goals for this iteration of the Nova process (e.g. improve performance, enhance security, etc.).

Evaluation and Suggestion Phase
a. Methodically evaluate each module in the existing implementation one by one.
b. For each module, list its strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement.
c. Gather inputs from domain experts on possible enhancements and modifications.
d. Prioritize the suggestions based on their impact and feasibility.
e. Document the evaluation and recommendations for each module.

Implementation Phase
a. For each module, begin by reviewing the documented recommendations from the previous phase.
b. Implement the enhancements and modifications suggested in the previous phase.
c. Ensure that each module is tested for functionality and performance.
d. Document the changes made, including code snippets and configurations.

Summary
a. Provide a summary of the changes made in this iteration, including the goals that were achieved.
b. List any outstanding issues or recommendations that need to be addressed in future iterations.

Cycle Back
a. Once the summary is complete, cycle back to the "Define File Tree and Goals" phase.
b. This time, evaluate the newly implemented changes and gather feedback.
c. Continue this cycle iteratively, always thinking methodically and meticulously.

Note

After a few cycles, it might be beneficial to conduct user testing or gather external feedback to ensure that the application is aligning with user needs and expectations.
Keep track of the iterations to understand the evolution of the application and to ensure that each cycle brings meaningful improvements.
Start the Cycle

Begin with the "Define File Tree and Goals" phase. Define the file tree and set the goals for this iteration. Proceed through the phases methodically and meticulously, and summarize the results at the end before cycling back for the next iteration.
