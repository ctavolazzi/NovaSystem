The new code is an improvement over the previous one in several ways. Firstly, it includes error handling techniques such as checking for null or undefined values before accessing the array of numbers. This ensures that the code handles errors gracefully and provides a better user experience. Additionally, the code uses a more efficient data structure (hash table) to store the array of numbers, which results in better performance.

Secondly, the new code is more readable and easier to understand due to proper indentation, spacing, and comments. This makes it easier for developers to understand the code's functionality and modify it as needed. Furthermore, the code includes documentation and comments that explain the purpose and functionality of each section.

In terms of addressing the focus area, the new code addresses this by replacing the array of numbers with a more efficient data structure that meets the user's requirements and modifying the `sampleFunction()` function to perform specific actions based on the input parameters. This ensures that the code is aligned with the original example code and demonstrates the functionality of the `sampleFunction()` function.

Overall, the new code is an improvement over the previous one in terms of readability, error handling, efficiency, documentation, and how well it addresses the focus area. It provides a better user experience and ensures that the code handles errors gracefully and performs efficiently. Therefore, the best overall version of the code is the new code.
