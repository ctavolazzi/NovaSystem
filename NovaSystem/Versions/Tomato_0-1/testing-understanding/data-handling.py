# Create a simulation of the data processing of the Nova system

# Import libraries

# Import data

# Simulate the user logging in

# Simulate the user makig a request

# Simulate the user's request being handled by the CentralController

# Simulate the user's CentralController processing the request

# Simulate the user's CentralController sending the request to the appropriate Controller

# Simulate a call to the local ResearchHub, which will return a method to process the request

# Simulate the CentralController spinning up a Bot in the User's BotHub

# Simulate the Bot processing the request

# Simulate the Bot sending the results of the opearation to the ResearchHub

# Simulate the CentralController receiving the results from the Bot and then putting the bot to sleep inside the BotHub

# Simulate the CentralController sending the results to the User

# Simulate the User receiving the results and the User's request being completed and thier display being updated

# Throughout the simulation, log the data processing steps and the data being processed and run tests to ensure that the data is being processed correctly
