## Introduction

John, a middle-aged accountant, was sipping his morning coffee while scrolling through his news feed. Headlines about artificial intelligence, autonomous agents, and AGI were becoming increasingly common. He had read about the Singularity, a threshold promising a future where AI would reshape the world. It was a topic of earnest discussion and analysis, far from the realms of science fiction he enjoyed as a young man.

His weird coworker talked about the advancement of AGI, heralding a time of significant transformation, of a time without jobs, without money.

Nonsense.

John shrugged it off. There was no way that any such thing would ever exist.

"These people are just lazy and don't want to work." John thought, trying to make himself feel better. But it didn't help the gnawing feeling growing inside of him. 

John worried about of the obsolescence of numerous professions, his own included, and forecasted a period of profound societal unrest that could catch governments unawares. He shrugged it off, considering it all speculative and distant.

Later that day, while walking down the street, he noticed a crowd gathering. As he approached, he saw the cause of the commotion - a robot, a droid, like in the movies, walking down the street, interacting with the environment, talking just like a human would. It was a jarring sight, a stark reminder of the news he had read that morning. The Singularity wasn't a distant concept anymore; it was walking right in front of him. The world was changing, and it was happening faster than he had ever imagined.

John watched as a kid threw a football at the robot's back and the robot whirred around and caught the ball perfectly. A hush fell over the crowd.

The robot simply chuckled and said "Catch!" and threw the ball back.
