## Steps for Development

### Code Review and File Organization
```python
# Step 1: Review each uploaded file to understand its content
# This will help in identifying overlapping or redundant code, as well as any gaps.

# List the uploaded files
uploaded_files = [
    '1_Combined_NovaSystem_Version_Extended (1).py',
    'Advanced_Expanded_NovaSystem_with_CLI.py',
    'Final_Optimized_Combined_File.py',
    'WinfoBot_and_NovaSystem_Design.txt',
    'Final_NovaSystem_CompleteCode (1).py',
    'Further_Re_Combined_WinfoNova_File.py',
    'NovaSystem_v0.1.2_Expanded.py',
    'Optimized_Combined_File.py'
]

# Perform a quick scan of each file to summarize its contents
# Use functions to read the file and return a summary
```

### Identify Overlaps and Gaps
```python
# Step 2: Identify overlapping and unique code blocks
# Prioritize the most optimized and updated versions of the code

# Create a function to compare files and identify overlaps and gaps
def identify_overlaps_and_gaps(files):
    # Your code logic here
    pass
```

### Merge and Document
```python
# Step 3: Merge the unique and most optimized code blocks into a single Python file
# Create a function to merge files
def merge_files(files):
    # Your code logic here
    pass

# Create a single design document that includes all the relevant information
# Use comments in the code to explain functionalities
```

### Final Review
```python
# Step 4: Conduct a final review to ensure that all steps are properly executed
# Make sure that the end result is a single, comprehensive set of instructions for developing the WinfoNova app
```
