# Working Example

## Test the Working Example:
Run `node auto-coder.js` to test the working example of the `auto-coder` tool.

This directory contains a working example of the `auto-coder` tool. Follow the steps below to get your own example up and running.

## Steps to Get the Working Example Running

Create a new folder and run the following commands:

1. **Copy the `setup.js` Script into a New Blank Directory**

   Name the new directory anything you want, for example, you could name it `auto-coder-example`.

   Copy `setup.js` from the following URL into this directory:

   [setup.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctavolazzi/NovaSystem/main/freebies/auto-coder/setup_example/setup.js)

2. **Ensure Ollama is Running**

   Make sure Ollama is running on your local machine.

3. **Run the Setup Script**

   Execute the `setup.js` script to install the necessary dependencies and set up the project:

   ```bash
   node setup.js
   ```

4. **Run the Auto Coder Script**

   Once the setup is complete, start the `auto-coder` by running:

   ```bash
   node auto-coder.js
   ```

That's it!

You can stop execution and modify the `config.json` and `example_code.txt` files at any time.
