Title: Changing human's impression of empathy from agent by verbalizing agent's position
Authors: Takahiro Tsumura, Seiji Yamada
Abstract: As anthropomorphic agents (AI and robots) are increasingly used in society,
empathy and trust between people and agents are becoming increasingly
important. A better understanding of agents by people will help to improve the
problems caused by the future use of agents in society. In the past, there has
been a focus on the importance of self-disclosure and the relationship between
agents and humans in their interactions. In this study, we focused on the
attributes of self-disclosure and the relationship between agents and people.
An experiment was conducted to investigate hypotheses on trust and empathy with
agents through six attributes of self-disclosure (opinions and attitudes,
hobbies, work, money, personality, and body) and through competitive and
cooperative relationships before a robotic agent performs a joint task. The
experiment consisted of two between-participant factors: six levels of
self-disclosure attributes and two levels of relationship with the agent. The
results showed that the two factors had no effect on trust in the agent, but
there was statistical significance for the attribute of self-disclosure
regarding a person's empathy toward the agent. In addition, statistical
significance was found regarding the agent's ability to empathize with a person
as perceived by the person only in the case where the type of relationship,
competitive or cooperative, was presented. The results of this study could lead
to an effective method for building relationships with agents, which are
increasingly used in society.
