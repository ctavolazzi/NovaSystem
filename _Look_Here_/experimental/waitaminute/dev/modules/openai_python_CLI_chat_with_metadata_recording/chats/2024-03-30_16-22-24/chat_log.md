**User:** I'm trying to see how much metadata I can record with each session feasibly

**Assistant:** Sure, when it comes to recording metadata for each session, it's important to maintain a balance between collecting valuable information and respecting user privacy. Some common types of metadata that can be recorded include:

1. Timestamp of the session
2. User ID (if applicable)
3. Session duration
4. Device type and browser information
5. Geolocation (if relevant and permission is granted)
6. Actions taken during the session (e.g., clicks, keystrokes)
7. Referral source (how the user arrived at the session)
8. IP address (consider anonymizing this data)

It's essential to be transparent with users about the data you collect and to handle it securely in accordance with relevant privacy regulations. Be sure to regularly review and update your data collection practices to ensure they align with best practices and user expectations.
