# Design Patterns for NovaSystem

Welcome to the design patterns documentation for NovaSystem, a self-modifying AI SDK designed for the creation of polymorphic applications. This folder serves as a comprehensive guide to the design patterns we've implemented, each playing a crucial role in supporting the dynamic and adaptable nature of NovaSystem.

### Introduction
This section elaborates on the role of design patterns in NovaSystem. It highlights how these patterns contribute to the architecture, facilitating the SDK's unique ability to self-modify and adapt for creating polymorphic applications.

### Pattern Categories
- **Creational Patterns**: Essential for dynamic object creation in AI contexts.
- **Structural Patterns**: Key to organizing system architecture for flexibility and scalability.
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Crucial for the complex interactions within AI components.
- **Concurrency Patterns**: Central to managing the multi-threaded aspects of AI processing.

### List of Design Patterns
1. **Factory Method**
   - Description: Centralizes object creation, enabling flexibility in specifying the type of objects created.
   - Implementation: [factory_method.md](/patterns/factory_method.md)
2. **Observer Pattern**
   - Description: Vital for event handling, particularly in adaptive UIs or responsive system modules.
   - Implementation: [observer.md](/patterns/observer.md)
3. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Description: Allows the SDK to select and modify algorithms at runtime, supporting polymorphic behavior.
   - Implementation: [strategy.md](/patterns/strategy.md)
4. [Add more patterns as relevant]

### Usage in AI and Polymorphism
Detail how these design patterns specifically enhance the capabilities of AI and support polymorphic application development in NovaSystem. Discuss any special considerations for implementing these patterns in an AI context.

### Contribution Guidelines
Provide instructions for contributors on how to propose new patterns, modify existing ones, and adhere to the project's coding and documentation standards.

### Contact Information
List the project lead or team members to contact for further information or collaboration on the design patterns within NovaSystem.
