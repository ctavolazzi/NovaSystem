Here is the cleaned and formatted code:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define an array of integers to store the key-value pairs
    int keys[10] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
    int values[10] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 };

    // Define a hash function to map the keys to indices in the array
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % 10;
    }

    // Use the hash function to store the key-value pairs in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        keys[hash(i)] = i;
        values[hash(i)] = i * 10;
    }

    // Print the key-value pairs stored in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        cout << "Key: " << keys[i] << ", Value: " << values[i] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
The generated code is a two-dimensional array of integers that stores the key-value pairs in an efficient data structure. The hash function maps the keys to indices in the array, and the `for` loop iterates over the array to store the key-value pairs. The code uses meaningful variable names to improve readability and maintainability.

The focus area of improving code readability and maintainability is addressed by using consistent coding styles throughout the codebase, including indentation, spacing, and naming conventions. This will make the code easier to read and maintain for future developers. Additionally, the generated code could be improved by using a similar hash function to hash the key to an index in the array, as suggested above.

The revised code is:
```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    // Define an array of integers to store the key-value pairs
    int keys[10] = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };
    int values[10] = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 };

    // Define a hash function to map the keys to indices in the array
    int hash(int key) {
        return key % 10;
    }

    // Use the hash function to store the key-value pairs in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        keys[hash(i)] = i;
        values[hash(i)] = i * 10;
    }

    // Print the key-value pairs stored in the array
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        cout << "Key: " << keys[i] << ", Value: " << values[i] << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
