The user's input requests a sample function that focuses on improving code readability and maintainability. The goal of this focus area is to make the code easier for future developers to understand and modify without introducing errors or bugs.
To achieve this, the next steps include renaming variables with descriptive names, extracting common functionality into separate functions, using abstraction to simplify complex algorithms, adding comments to explain the purpose of each section, and testing the code with different input parameters to identify any bugs or edge cases.
Overall, the user is looking for a solution that can help improve the readability and maintainability of the code, making it easier for future developers to work on and modify.
