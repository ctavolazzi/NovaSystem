1. Yes, there is a major discrepancy between the original example code and the generated code. In the original example code, variables are defined and used to store values, while in the generated code, no variable declaration is found.
2. The major discrepancies include the lack of variable declaration in the generated code and the different argument usage in the sampleFunction() function. 
3. To improve the generated code, it should define variables to store values similar to the example code. Additionally, the sampleFunction() function should be called with specific arguments to demonstrate its functionality. 
4. The generated code does not adequately address the specified focus area of "Initial focus on code structure and functionality." However, by defining variables and calling the sampleFunction() function with specific arguments, the generated code can better align with the original example code in terms of structure and functionality.
