- ⬜ Enhanced error handling and recovery strategies
- ⬜ Support for more repository types (GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.)

### Features
- ⬜ LLM integration for more advanced documentation parsing
- ⬜ Support for executing non-shell commands (Python scripts, etc.)
- ⬜ Interactive mode for command execution
- ⬜ Support for user input during command execution
- ⬜ Web interface for viewing results

### Testing
- ⬜ Complete test coverage for all modules
- ⬜ Integration tests
- ⬜ Docker-based tests
- ⬜ CI/CD pipeline configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive unit tests for all modules
2. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation and usage examples
3. **Refinement**: Polish error handling and improve robustness
4. **Additional Features**: Implement pending features based on priority

## Roadmap to 1.0.0

1. Complete core implementation and testing (current phase)
2. Beta testing with real-world repositories
3. Performance optimization and robustness improvements
4. Documentation completion
5. Release 1.0.0

## Advanced Architecture Integration

The current implementation lays the groundwork for the more advanced architecture described in the requirements:

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: The current Nova class can be extended to support orchestration of specialized agents
- **Enhanced Memory System**: The database infrastructure can be enhanced to support the advanced memory system
- **Agent Specialization**: The system is designed to accommodate specialized agents for different repository types
- **Advanced LLM Integration**: The current structure allows for easy integration of LLM capabilities

The MVP implementation focuses on the core functionality while setting the stage for the more advanced features.
