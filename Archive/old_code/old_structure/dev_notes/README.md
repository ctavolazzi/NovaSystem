# NovaSystem: Agent Framework & Process Implementation

## Project Overview & Purpose

This document details the implementation of core components for the NovaSystem project, focusing on the agent framework, process orchestration, session management, and API layer. The work documented here represents the foundation of a comprehensive multi-agent problem-solving system designed to tackle complex problems through structured collaboration between specialized AI agents.

## Why We Built This

The NovaSystem is designed to overcome limitations of single-agent approaches to problem-solving by:

1. **Leveraging Specialized Expertise**: Different problems require different types of expertise, which no single agent can fully embody
2. **Providing Structured Collaboration**: A defined process ensures agents work together effectively rather than talking past each other
3. **Enabling Critical Analysis**: Dedicated critical analysis prevents "groupthink" and identifies blind spots
4. **Supporting Iterative Refinement**: Complex problems are rarely solved in one pass; iteration allows for progressive improvement

## Components Implemented

### 1. Agent Framework

We implemented three specialized agent types essential to the NovaSystem:

#### Discussion Continuity Expert (DCE) Agent
**What**: An agent responsible for maintaining conversation flow and ensuring coherent problem-solving.
**Why**: Conversations between multiple agents can easily lose focus or coherence. The DCE provides a "meta" perspective that keeps the process on track and ensures that the conversation progresses meaningfully.

#### Critical Analysis Expert (CAE) Agent
**What**: An agent that critically evaluates proposed solutions, identifies weaknesses, and suggests improvements.
**Why**: Without dedicated critical analysis, collaborative systems tend toward consensus and can miss important flaws. The CAE plays the vital role of constructive critic, systematically analyzing proposed solutions to strengthen them.

#### Domain Expert Agent
**What**: A flexible agent template that can be specialized for different domains of knowledge.
**Why**: Real-world problems often require specialized knowledge from various domains. Creating a flexible Domain Expert template allows the system to dynamically assemble the right team of experts based on the problem's requirements.

#### Agent Factory
**What**: A module that handles the creation and configuration of different agent types.
**Why**: Centralizing agent creation provides a consistent interface for agent instantiation, simplifies configuration management, and enables dynamic team assembly based on the problem needs.

### 2. Process Orchestration

#### Nova Process Manager
**What**: A manager that orchestrates the multi-stage problem-solving workflow.
**Why**: Effective problem-solving requires a structured approach. The Nova Process Manager implements a defined workflow that guides the collaboration between agents through distinct stages, ensuring a comprehensive treatment of the problem.

#### Process Stages
**What**: Implementation of the five core stages of the Nova Process:
1. **Problem Unpacking**: Breaking down complex problems
2. **Expertise Assembly**: Identifying required domain expertise
3. **Collaborative Ideation**: Gathering expert perspectives
4. **Critical Analysis**: Critically evaluating proposed solutions
5. **Summary and Next Steps**: Synthesizing progress and planning ahead

**Why**: Each stage addresses a specific aspect of the problem-solving process, ensuring that the problem is thoroughly analyzed, the right expertise is brought to bear, solutions are generated collaboratively, and critical feedback is incorporated into the final outcome.

### 3. Session Management

#### Session Manager
**What**: A system for managing user sessions and conversations.
**Why**: Long-running problem-solving processes need persistence and continuity. The Session Manager allows users to engage with the system over time, preserving context and conversation history.

#### Message Management
**What**: Functionality for storing, retrieving, and managing messages within sessions.
**Why**: Conversations generate valuable data that needs to be tracked, retrieved, and analyzed. The message management system provides a structured way to handle this information.

### 4. API Layer

#### Nova Process API
**What**: API endpoints for interacting with the Nova Process.
**Why**: A clean API interface is essential for front-end integration and exposing the system's capabilities. The Nova Process API provides a well-defined interface for starting and continuing iterations, retrieving information, and managing the process.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Agent Framework

The agent framework is built on:
- A common abstract base Agent class
- Specialized implementations for each agent type
- Configuration systems for customizing agent behavior
- Memory management for conversation history
- Integration with LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama)

### Process Orchestration

The process orchestration system features:
- State management for tracking progress through stages
- Session and iteration identification
- Dynamic agent creation based on identified expertise
- Structured data flow between stages
- Result aggregation and synthesis

### Session Management

The session management system includes:
- Unique session identification
- User attribution
- Message storage and retrieval
- Session metadata management
- Activity tracking

### API Layer

The API layer provides:
- RESTful endpoints for all core functions
- Request validation using Pydantic models
- Dependency injection for retrieving sessions and iterations
- Error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Documentation via FastAPI's automatic docs generation

## Future Directions

Building on this foundation, the next steps for the NovaSystem include:

1. **Frontend Implementation**: Developing a SvelteKit-based UI to interact with the system
2. **Testing Suite**: Creating comprehensive tests for all components
3. **Database Integration**: Moving from in-memory storage to persistent database
4. **Deployment Infrastructure**: Setting up Docker containers and CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

The work documented here forms the backbone of the NovaSystem, implementing the core functionality needed for multi-agent problem-solving. By designing with modularity, extensibility, and clear separation of concerns, we've created a solid foundation for future development while delivering immediate functional value.

The agent framework, process orchestration, session management, and API layer work together to provide a cohesive system that can tackle complex problems through a structured, collaborative approach. This represents a significant step toward more effective AI-assisted problem-solving that leverages the strengths of specialized expertise within a defined process framework.
