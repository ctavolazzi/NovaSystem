- User Interface Dashboard

## Progress Notes:

### GitHub Repository Validator
- Basic validation with GitHub API working
- Repository metadata extraction implemented
- Support for private repositories with token authentication
- Project type detection (Python, Node.js, Java, Go)

### Docker Container Agent
- Container creation based on project type
- Repository installation from GitHub
- Test execution within container
- Environment variables support
- Dependency management for different project types

### Environment Variables Support
- Pass environment variables to Docker containers
- Update environment variables in running containers
- Retrieve environment variables from containers
- Comprehensive test cases for all environment variable operations

### Testing with Real Repositories
- Complete test flow with real GitHub repositories
- Test with different project types (Python, Node.js, Java)
- Command-line arguments for flexible testing
- Comprehensive test coverage

### Failure Analysis
- Detection and categorization of common test failures
- Project-specific recommendations for fixing issues
- Report generation in multiple formats (Markdown, HTML, JSON)
- Integration with Docker test output
- Comprehensive test coverage for various failure types

### Unified CLI Interface
- Comprehensive command-line interface for all operations
- Support for repository validation, container setup, test execution, and failure analysis
- Flexible output formats (JSON, Markdown, HTML)
- Environment variable configuration
- Detailed logging and error reporting

### Automation Script
- Script to automate the test execution process
- Integration with Docker Container Agent
- Support for different project types

### Test Mode Support
- Simulate test operations without actual Docker operations
- Support for different project types (Python, Node.js, etc.)
- Integration with Docker Container Agent
- Ability to simulate failing tests for testing failure analysis

## Next Steps:
1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching for repository metadata
   - Optimize Docker container lifecycle
   - Parallelize test execution

2. **User Interface Dashboard**
   - Create a web interface for GitHub repository management
   - Add container monitoring dashboard
   - Implement test result visualization
   - Build failure analysis dashboard

3. **Extended Documentation**
   - Complete API documentation
   - Write user guides
   - Create developer documentation

## Recent Updates:
- Added support for simulating failing tests in test mode with the `--simulate-failing-tests` flag
- Fixed project type detection in test mode to correctly identify and use repository type
- Verified complete flow for both Python and Node.js repositories in test mode
- Improved container metadata management to ensure consistent data sharing across components
- Improved test mode functionality to properly share container instances across operations
- Fixed container tracking in test mode for the automation script
- Completed Failure Analysis component with test result parsing and report generation
- Implemented categorization of test failures and project-specific recommendations
- Added integration tests for the complete GitHub Docker Analysis flow
- Created unified CLI interface for all GitHub Docker integration functionality
- Fixed issues with HTML report generation
- Made CLI scripts executable

## Notes:
All components are now production-ready with comprehensive error handling and logging.
The system provides a complete flow from GitHub repository validation to Docker container
creation, test execution, and failure analysis with actionable recommendations.

The unified CLI interface provides a user-friendly way to interact with all components
of the system, making it easy to integrate into existing workflows and automation scripts.

Test mode functionality now properly simulates all operations without requiring actual Docker
operations, making it ideal for testing and development environments without Docker installed.
The system can correctly identify and handle different project types (Python, Node.js, etc.)
both in real mode and test mode, ensuring consistent behavior across environments.
