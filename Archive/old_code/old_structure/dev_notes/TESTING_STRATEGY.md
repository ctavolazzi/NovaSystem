# NovaSystem Testing Strategy

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the NovaSystem project, detailing the approach to testing the agent framework, process orchestration, session management, and API layer.

## Testing Philosophy

The NovaSystem testing strategy is built on the following principles:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all critical paths and edge cases
2. **Isolation**: Test components in isolation before integration
3. **Realistic Scenarios**: Test with realistic use cases and data
4. **Automation**: Prioritize automated testing for continuous validation
5. **Mock External Dependencies**: Use mocks for external services like LLM providers

## Test Types

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- **Agent Framework Tests**: Test individual agent methods and behaviors
- **Process Stage Tests**: Test each process stage in isolation
- **Session Management Tests**: Test session and message handling
- **API Endpoint Tests**: Test API request/response handling

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that components work together properly:

- **Agent Collaboration Tests**: Test interaction between different agent types
- **Process Flow Tests**: Test the complete Nova Process workflow
- **API Integration Tests**: Test API with real session and process management

### End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests validate the complete system behavior:

- **Workflow Tests**: Test complete problem-solving workflows
- **UI/API Tests**: Test the frontend and API working together
- **Performance Tests**: Test system performance under load

## Test Structure

The test suite is organized as follows:

```
NovaSystem/backend/tests/
├── conftest.py                    # Shared test fixtures and utilities
├── unit/                          # Unit tests

    └── test_api_integration.py    # API integration tests
```

## Testing Tools and Libraries

The NovaSystem testing suite uses:

- **pytest**: Primary testing framework
- **pytest-asyncio**: For testing async code
- **pytest-mock**: For mocking and patching
- **httpx**: For testing HTTP endpoints
- **pytest-cov**: For code coverage reporting

## Key Test Cases

### Agent Framework Tests

1. **Base Agent Tests**
   - Test memory storage and retrieval
   - Test tool registration and usage
   - Test agent initialization with different configs

2. **DCE Agent Tests**
   - Test conversation continuity handling
   - Test context awareness
   - Test response generation

3. **CAE Agent Tests**
   - Test critical analysis of proposed solutions
   - Test weakness identification
   - Test improvement suggestions
   - Test structured response parsing

4. **Domain Expert Tests**
   - Test domain-specific prompt generation
   - Test expertise application
   - Test domain insight extraction
   - Test different domains of expertise

5. **Agent Factory Tests**
   - Test creation of different agent types
   - Test configuration handling
   - Test provider selection logic

### Process Management Tests

1. **Stage Execution Tests**
   - Test each process stage individually
   - Test stage transitions
   - Test result handling

2. **Iteration Management Tests**
   - Test iteration creation and tracking
   - Test continuation across stages
   - Test iteration completion

3. **Process Flow Tests**
   - Test the complete process flow
   - Test handling of different problem types
   - Test expert identification and assignment

### Session Management Tests

1. **Session CRUD Tests**
   - Test session creation, retrieval, update, deletion
   - Test user attribution
   - Test session metadata

2. **Message Management Tests**
   - Test message storage and retrieval
   - Test message ordering and filtering
   - Test metadata handling

### API Tests

1. **Nova Process API Tests**
   - Test iteration creation endpoints
   - Test iteration continuation endpoints
   - Test iteration retrieval endpoints
   - Test error handling

2. **Request Validation Tests**
   - Test handling of valid requests
   - Test rejection of invalid requests
   - Test proper error responses

## Mocking Strategy

For testing components that depend on external services:

1. **LLM Provider Mocks**
   - Create mock LLM providers that return predefined responses
   - Simulate different response patterns (success, error, timeout)
   - Test handling of various response qualities

2. **Database Mocks**
   - Use in-memory databases for testing
   - Create mock repositories for isolation testing
   - Test data persistence and retrieval

3. **External API Mocks**
   - Mock external API calls
   - Test handling of API responses and errors
   - Simulate network conditions

## Test Data

The test suite uses:

1. **Fixture Data**
   - Predefined problem statements
   - Sample agent responses
   - Example process iterations

2. **Generated Data**
   - Dynamically generated test cases
   - Randomized inputs for edge case testing
   - Stress test data volumes

## Continuous Integration

The tests are integrated with CI/CD:

1. **GitHub Actions**
   - Run tests on every pull request
   - Run tests on main branch commits
   - Generate and publish coverage reports

2. **Test Requirements**
   - All tests must pass before merging
   - Coverage thresholds must be met
   - No regressions allowed

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Unit Tests**: Focus first on core agent and process tests
2. **Add Integration Tests**: Once units are stable, add integration tests
3. **Develop E2E Tests**: Add end-to-end tests with UI integration
4. **Set Up CI Pipeline**: Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
5. **Monitor Coverage**: Track and improve test coverage over time

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the NovaSystem. By combining unit, integration, and end-to-end tests with appropriate mocking and test data, we can verify that the system works as expected in isolation and as a whole.

The test suite will evolve alongside the codebase, maintaining high standards of quality and reliability throughout the development process.
