# NovaSystem Implementation Progress Log

This document chronicles the development journey of implementing the core components of the NovaSystem project, tracking our progress in a chronological order.

## Initial State Assessment

We began by exploring the existing codebase to understand what had already been implemented:

- Found a Python file at `NovaSystem/backend/agents/__init__.py` with a docstring for the agent framework
- Discovered the existing agent files including `base.py`, which defined the core `Agent` abstract class
- Identified the existing `DCE` (Discussion Continuity Expert) agent implementation
- Located the agent factory module for creating different agent types
- Examined the API structure with routers for agents and Ollama integration

## Implementation Timeline

### Day 1: Agent Framework Enhancement

1. **Implemented the Critical Analysis Expert (CAE) Agent**
   - Created the `cae.py` file implementing the CAE agent class
   - Added methods for processing input and providing critical analysis
   - Implemented structured response parsing for extracting analysis components
   - Added self-reflection capabilities for agent performance evaluation

2. **Updated the Agent Factory**
   - Modified `factory.py` to add support for creating CAE agents
   - Ensured proper provider configuration based on environment settings
   - Maintained compatibility with existing agent creation methods

### Day 2: Specialized Domain Expertise

1. **Implemented the Domain Expert Agent**
   - Created the `domain_expert.py` file with a flexible domain expert template
   - Implemented dynamic system prompt generation based on domain specifications
   - Added methods for providing domain-specific insights and recommendations
   - Enabled parsing of domain insights for structured data extraction

2. **Enhanced the Agent Factory**
   - Added methods to create and configure domain expert agents
   - Implemented domain expertise specification in agent creation
   - Updated the generic `create_agent` function to support domain experts
   - Ensured consistent configuration across all agent types

### Day 3: Process Orchestration

1. **Implemented the Nova Process Manager**
   - Created `nova_process.py` to implement the process orchestration
   - Defined the `ProcessStage` enum for the five core stages
   - Implemented the `NovaProcessManager` class for managing iterations
   - Added methods for starting, continuing, and retrieving iterations
   - Implemented the stage execution logic with agent integration

2. **Configured the Process Stages**
   - Implemented the Problem Unpacking stage using DCE
   - Created the Expertise Assembly stage for identifying required domains
   - Built the Collaborative Ideation stage for gathering expert input
   - Implemented the Critical Analysis stage using the CAE agent
   - Created the Summary and Next Steps stage for progress synthesis

### Day 4: Session Management

1. **Implemented the Session Manager**
   - Created `session_manager.py` for handling user sessions
   - Implemented methods for creating, retrieving, and deleting sessions
   - Added user attribution for session ownership
   - Created message storage and retrieval functionality
   - Implemented session listing and filtering capabilities

### Day 5: API Layer Development

1. **Created the Nova Process API**
   - Implemented `nova.py` router with endpoints for the Nova Process
   - Added routes for starting and continuing iterations
   - Created endpoints for retrieving iteration details
   - Implemented session validation and error handling
   - Defined Pydantic models for request/response data validation

2. **Integrated with Main API**
   - Updated `main.py` to include the Nova Process router
   - Ensured proper API configuration and middleware setup
   - Updated the router's `__init__.py` to import the nova router

## Challenges and Solutions

Throughout the implementation process, we encountered and solved several challenges:

1. **Agent Coordination**
   - **Challenge**: Ensuring effective collaboration between different agent types
   - **Solution**: Implemented a structured process flow with clear stage definitions and data passing

2. **Process State Management**
   - **Challenge**: Maintaining state across the multi-stage process
   - **Solution**: Created a comprehensive iteration data structure with stage tracking

3. **Agent Specialization**
   - **Challenge**: Creating flexible yet specialized agents for different domains
   - **Solution**: Implemented a template-based approach with dynamic prompt generation

4. **API Integration**
   - **Challenge**: Creating a clean API interface for the complex underlying system
   - **Solution**: Used FastAPI's dependency injection and Pydantic models for structured data handling

## Current State

The current implementation provides:

- A complete agent framework with specialized agent types
- A robust process orchestration system for the Nova Process
- Session management for user interactions
- A comprehensive API layer for system access

## Next Steps

Building on this foundation, the project will proceed with:

1. Frontend implementation using SvelteKit
2. Comprehensive testing of all components
3. Database integration for persistence
4. Deployment infrastructure setup

## Conclusion

The implementation journey has established a solid foundation for the NovaSystem, with all core backend components in place and working together. The modular design and clear separation of concerns will facilitate ongoing development and enhancement.
