## What is Svelte?

Svelte is a new way to build web applications. It's a compiler that takes your declarative components and converts them into efficient JavaScript that surgically updates the DOM.

Learn more at the [Svelte website](https://svelte.dev), or stop by the [Discord chatroom](https://svelte.dev/chat).

## Getting started

You can play around with Svelte in the [tutorial](https://learn.svelte.dev/), [examples](https://svelte.dev/examples), and [REPL](https://svelte.dev/repl).

When you're ready to build a full-fledge application, we recommend using [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev):

```bash
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

See [the SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) to learn more.
