Title: Envisioning the Next-Generation AI Coding Assistants: Insights & Proposals
Authors: Khanh Nghiem, Anh Minh Nguyen, Nghi D. Q. Bui
Abstract: As a research-product hybrid group in AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE), we
present four key takeaways from our experience developing in-IDE AI coding
assistants. AI coding assistants should set clear expectations for usage,
integrate with advanced IDE capabilities and existing extensions, use
extendable backend designs, and collect app data responsibly for downstream
analyses. We propose open questions and challenges that academia and industry
should address to realize the vision of next-generation AI coding assistants.
