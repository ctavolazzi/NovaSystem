Improving readability and clarity:
1. Add comments to help explain the purpose and function of each section of code in generate_identity().
2. Make variable names more descriptive, such as first_name instead of first_index. This makes it easier for other developers to understand the code. 
3. Make function calls more descriptive, for example, 'numpy.random.choices' instead of just 'numpy.random.choice'.

Error handling:
1. Add an if statement to check whether the inputs are empty and raise a ValueError if they are. This helps prevent unexpected errors when calling the generate_identity() function with empty input lists. 
2. Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors that may arise from using NumPy arrays or dictionaries to store identities. These blocks will help ensure that the code can handle errors gracefully and provide a more user-friendly experience. 
3. When using parallel processing, add an if statement to check whether the number of identities is evenly divisible by the number of processors, and raise a ValueError if it isn't. This helps prevent unexpected errors when generating large datasets.

Efficiency and performance:
1. Replace repeated calls to 'numpy.random.choice' with a single call to 'numpy.random.choices' to generate all the necessary elements for each identity in parallel. This reduces overhead due to repeated function calls and improves performance. 
2. Replace lists with NumPy arrays or dictionaries to store identities, which can handle large amounts of data more efficiently. These structures are optimized for fast lookups and insertions, making them ideal for storing and retrieving identities. 
3. Optimize data storage by storing only the necessary information for each identity, such as the name and backstory, rather than storing all details. This reduces memory usage and improves performance when generating large datasets.
4. Add an if statement to check whether the number of identities is evenly divisible by the number of processors, and raise a ValueError if it isn't. This helps prevent unexpected errors when generating large datasets. 
5. Use more efficient algorithms for generating unique identities, such as using a randomized sampling algorithm with a set of possible combinations rather than a brute-force approach. These algorithms are optimized for large datasets and can generate unique identities faster and more efficiently.

Documentation and comments:
1. Add documentation to the function signature, explaining the purpose and expected input/output of the generate_identity() function. 
2. Add comments throughout the code to explain the reasoning behind each section or decision made in the code. This helps other developers understand the code more easily and provides a clear explanation for future maintainers or users who may need to modify or extend the functionality of the code. 
3. Include an overall description of the code, highlighting its purpose, main features, and assumptions. This helps provide context for understanding the code's behavior and ensures that it meets the user's requirements effectively.
