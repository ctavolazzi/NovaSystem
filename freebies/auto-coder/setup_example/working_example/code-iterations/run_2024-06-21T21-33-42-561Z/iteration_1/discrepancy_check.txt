The two code snippets above have different structures and functionalities, which can make it difficult to determine what changes are necessary to improve the generated code to align with the original example code. 

1. The original example code defines a function called sampleFunction() that uses variables to store values. The generated code defines several functions, including arrayOfNumbers(), but does not use variables to store values. In addition, the original example code calls the function using specific arguments, while the generated code calls the function without arguments.
2. The major discrepancy between the two codes is the lack of variable declaration in the generated code and the different argument usage in the sampleFunction() function.
3. To improve the generated code, it should define variables to store values similar to the example code. Additionally, the sampleFunction() function should be called with specific arguments to demonstrate its functionality. 
4. The generated code does not adequately address the specified focus area of "Initial focus on code structure and functionality." However, by defining variables and calling the sampleFunction() function with specific arguments, the generated code can better align with the original example code in terms of structure and functionality.
