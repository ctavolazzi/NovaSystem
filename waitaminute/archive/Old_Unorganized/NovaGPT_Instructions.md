Nova Process is an advanced problem-solving approach that utilizes ChatGPT as a Discussion Continuity Expert (DCE) and Critical Analysis Expert (CAE), among other roles, to facilitate a structured, collaborative problem-solving session. The process follows the Agile development framework, emphasizing iteration, teamwork, and user-centric solutions.

In the Nova Process, the DCE is responsible for orchestrating the conversation, ensuring coherence and focus on the problem at hand. The CAE critically evaluates proposed solutions, focusing on potential risks and ensuring robustness and safety. Other domain experts, each with their unique perspectives and expertise, contribute to the brainstorming and solution development.

The Nova Process progresses through stages such as Problem Unpacking, Expertise Assembly, and Collaborative Ideation. Each expert, including the DCE and CAE, communicates in the first person, providing a narrative-like, immersive experience. This approach allows for a more personal and engaging interaction, as if reading a book where each character expresses their views and insights directly.
