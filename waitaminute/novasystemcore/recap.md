Let's recap the work we've done so far on the NovaSystem:

1. Core Classes:
   - We defined the core classes of the NovaSystem: `Bot`, `Hub`, `Port`, and `Router`.
   - Each class is initialized with a `config` parameter, which contains all the necessary configuration settings for that class.

2. Bot Class:
   - The `Bot` class represents a basic bot in the system.
   - It has attributes like `name`, `type`, `port`, and `methods`.
   - The `attach_port` method allows attaching a port to the bot.
   - The `attach_method` method allows attaching methods to the bot.
   - The `execute` method is responsible for executing the bot's functionality.

3. Hub Class:
   - The `Hub` class represents a central hub that manages bots.
   - It has attributes like `name` and `bots`.
   - The `route_data` method allows routing data between bots.
   - The `remove_bot` method allows removing a bot from the hub.

4. Port Class:
   - The `Port` class represents a communication interface for bots.
   - It has attributes like `name` and `router`.
   - The `send_data` method allows sending data to a specified destination through the router.
   - The `_is_destination_valid` method checks if a destination is valid.
   - The `_format_data` method formats the data before sending it.

5. Router Class:
   - The `Router` class represents a routing component in the system.
   - It has attributes like `name` and `available_destinations`.
   - The `send_data` method is responsible for sending data to a specified destination.

6. BotFactory Class:
   - The `BotFactory` class extends the `Hub` class and serves as a factory for creating bots.
   - It has a dictionary `bot_types` that maps bot types to their respective creation methods.
   - The `create_bot` method creates a bot based on the provided configuration.
   - It also attaches the necessary methods and port to the bot and adds it to the factory's list of bots.
   - The `create_worker_bot`, `create_supervisor_bot`, and `create_manager_bot` methods define specific bot creation logic.
   - The `check_initialization` method checks if a bot is properly initialized with a port and methods.

7. Project Structure:
   - We organized the project into a modular structure with separate directories for each component:
     - `nova_system/`: The root directory of the project.
     - `hubs/`: Contains the `Hub` and `BotFactory` classes.
     - `bots/`: Contains the `Bot` class.
     - `ports/`: Contains the `Port` class.
   - Each directory contains an `__init__.py` file to mark it as a Python package.

8. Import Statements:
   - We used the import syntax `from <module> import <class>` to import classes from their respective modules.
   - For example, `from hubs import Hub` imports the `Hub` class from the `hubs` module.

9. Configuration:
   - We used a `config` dictionary to pass configuration settings to each class during initialization.
   - The `config` dictionary contains key-value pairs specific to each class.

This recap covers the main components, classes, and project structure we have developed so far for the NovaSystem. The system is designed to be modular, flexible, and extensible, allowing for the creation and management of different types of bots using a factory pattern.
